## Installation and Load

```{r}
#devtools::install_github("stschn/marray")
library(marray)
```

## Creation

The basic function to create an array is `marray()` with corresponding dispatcher methods (S3 methods) for different data types like matrix, data.frame and list.

### From scratch

#### 1-dimensional array

```{r}
a <- marray(1:11)
a
```

#### 2-dimensional array (matrix) with row-major ordering

```{r}
a <- marray(1:12, dim = c(4, 3), order = "C") # order = "C" is default and doesn't need to pass explicitly
a
```

#### 2-dimensional array (matrix) with column-major ordering

```{r}
a <- marray(1:12, dim = c(4, 3), order = "F")
a
```

#### 3-dimensional array

The reading direction for an n-dimensional array with n > 2 is generally from right to left. The last dimension, axis is another word for dimension, represents a number of pages, sheets (both terms from [MatLab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html){target="_blank"}) or bunches, on each of which there are a number of further bunches. This number is taken from the penultimate dimension. On these bunches, in turn, there are a number of bunches corresponding to the penultimate dimension, and so on. The first two dimensions can then be combined into a matrix.

The following example creates a 4x3x2 array arranged in columns. There are 2 bunches (last dimension), on each of which there is a 4x3 matrix.

```{r}
a <- marray(1:24, dim = c(4, 3, 2), order = "F")
a
```

This example creates a 4x3x2x2 array arranged in rows.

```{r}
a <- marray(seq_len(4*3*2*2), dim = c(4, 3, 2, 2))
a
```

For better comprehension, the line-by-line arrangement shall be briefly sketched:

|          |            |            |            |            |
|----------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| **Value**| **1. axis**| **2. axis**| **3. axis**| **4. axis**|
| 1        | 1          | 1          | 1          | 1          |
| 2        | 1          | 1          | 1          | 2          |
| 3        | 1          | 1          | 2          | 1          |
| 4        | 1          | 1          | 2          | 2          |
| 5        | 1          | 2          | 1          | 1          |
| 6        | 1          | 2          | 1          | 2          |
| 7        | 1          | 2          | 2          | 1          |
| 8        | 1          | 2          | 2          | 2          |
| 9        | 1          | 3          | 1          | 1          |
| 10       | 1          | 3          | 1          | 2          |

For comparison, the same array with a column-major ordering:

```{r}
a <- marray(seq_len(4*3*2*2), dim = c(4, 3, 2, 2), order = "F")
a
```

|          |            |            |            |            |
|----------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| **Value**| **1. axis**| **2. axis**| **3. axis**| **4. axis**|
| 1        | 1          | 1          | 1          | 1          |
| 2        | 2          | 1          | 1          | 1          |
| 3        | 3          | 1          | 1          | 1          |
| 4        | 4          | 1          | 1          | 1          |
| 5        | 1          | 2          | 1          | 1          |
| 6        | 2          | 2          | 1          | 1          |
| 7        | 3          | 2          | 1          | 1          |
| 8        | 4          | 2          | 1          | 1          |
| 9        | 1          | 3          | 1          | 1          |
| 10       | 2          | 3          | 1          | 1          |

#### Excursus: algorithm for determining the corresponding position within an array

```{r}
shape <- c(4, 3, 2)
axis_index <- rep(1, length(shape))
len_data <- 24
for (d in (seq_len(len_data))) {
  print(axis_index)
  for (i in rev(seq_len(length(shape)))) { # drop rev() for column-major ordering
    axis_index[i] <- axis_index[i] + 1
    if (axis_index[i] <= shape[i])
      break
    else
      axis_index[i] <- 1
  }
}
```

In Python, the algorithm looks like:

```{python}
shape = (4, 3, 2)
N = len(shape)
axis_index = [1, ] * N
len_data = 24
for d in range(len_data):
    print(axis_index)
    # Get next dimension index
    # This is how row-major ordering works; without reversed: column-major ordering
    for i in reversed(range(N)):
        axis_index[i] += 1
        if axis_index[i] <= shape[i]:
            break
        else:
            axis_index[i] = 1
```


### On the basis of already given data with different types

```{r}
v <- 1:24
l <- list(x1 = 1:10, x2 = seq(10, 100, 10))
df <- data.frame(x1 = 1:6, x2 = seq(10, 60, 10), x3 = sample(letters, 6))
m <- matrix(1:24, nrow = 6)
a1 <- array(letters[1L:24L])
a3 <- array(v, dim = c(4, 3, 2))
a4 <- array(1:48, dim = c(4, 3, 2, 2))

data <- v # just change this value
a <- marray(data)
a
```

### By predefined creation routines

#### General creation routines

- `empty()` and `empty_like()`: creates an array with NA
- `zeros()` and `zeros_like()`: creates an array with 0
- `ones()` and `ones_like()`: creates an array with 1
- `full()` and `full_like()`: creates an array with value(s)

```{r}
# filled with NA
a <- empty(dim = c(4, 3)); a
# filled with Zeros
a <- zeros(dim = c(4, 3)); a
# filled with Ones
a <- ones(dim = c(4, 3)); a
# filled with value(s)
a <- full(dim = c(4, 3), fill_value = 11); a
a <- full(dim = c(4, 3), fill_value = c(11, 2, 23), order = "F"); a

# like an array
a <- marray(1:6, dim = c(3, 2))
ones_like(a)
```

#### Special creation routines

##### Identity matrix

$I_n \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & \ddots & \vdots \\ \vdots & \ddots & \ddots & 0 \\ 0 & \cdots & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$

```{r}
a <- maidentity(3)
a
```

```{r}
a <- eye(3)
a
a <- eye(3, 5)
a
```

##### Vandermonde matrix

For a n-tuple $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$:

$V(x \in \mathbb{R}^{n}) = V(x_1, x_2,...,x_n) = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & x_1 & x_1^2 & \cdots & x_1^{n-1} \\ 1 & x_2 & x_2^2 & \cdots & x_2^{n-1} \\ 1 & x_3 & x_3^2 & \cdots & x_3^{n-1} \\ \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ 1 & x_n & x_n^2 & \cdots & x_n^{n-1} \end{bmatrix}$

```{r}
a <- vander(1:5)
a
```

## Retrieving basic information

- `DIM()`: returns the shape (dimension space) of an R object or its length if it has no dimension attribute
- `ndim()`: returns the number of axes
- `nsize()`: returns the number of elements

```{r}
a <- marray(1:12, dim = c(4, 3, 1))
# Dimension space (shape)
print(paste(c("shape:", DIM(a)), collapse = " "))
# Number of dimensions (axes)
paste("number of dimensions:", ndim(a))
# Number of elements
paste("number of elements:", nsize(a))
```


## Accessing

Advanced indexing options are available for accessing an array.

- Use of the lowercase letters i, j, k, etc. (common mathematical indices) for the first, second, third axis, etc. The expression `i = 1:2, j = 2:4` selects positions 1 to 2 of the first axis and positions two to four of the second axis. If an array has more axes than the given indices, the remaining axes are used completely, i.e. without limitation in the access.
- Without special symbols (lowercase letters), only the order is decisive. The expression`1:2, 0, 2` selects positions 1 and 2 of the first axis, the entire second axis - besides `0`, `NULL` or `NA` can also be used, and the second position of the third axis.
- Both variants can also be packed into a list using `list()`. This allows dynamic compilation of an array indexing in code.

The core function is `slice()`.

### Read

```{r}
a <- marray(1:12, dim = c(4, 3))
slice(a, i = 2:4)
slice(a, list(i = 2:4))
slice(a, 2:4)
slice(a, list(2:4))

a <- marray(1:48, dim = c(4, 3, 2, 2))
# read complete four-dimensional array 
slice(a)
# the values of the second element of the last axis (4th dimension)
slice(a, l = 2) 
# the values of the first element of the first axis (1st row) and the third element of the second axis (3rd column) across all bunches of the remaining axes 3 and 4.
slice(a, i = 1, j = 3)
# read positions 2 and 3 from axis 1, positions 1 and 2 from axis 2, the whole axis 3, and position 2 from axis 4
slice(a, 2:3, 1:2, 0, 2)
```

### Write

```{r}
a <- marray(1:24, dim = c(4, 3, 2), order = "F")
# write 0 to the first axis (row) across all remaining axes
slice(a, i = 1L) <- 0L
a
# write 100-102 to the first axis (row) across all remaining axes
slice(a, i = 1L) <- 100:102
a 
# write 100-105 to the first axis (row) across all remaining axes
slice(a, i = 1L) <- 100:105
a
# equal to prior, nrow can be 1, 2, 3, or 6
slice(a, i = 1L) <- matrix(100:105, nrow = 3L)
a
```

## Subsetting

```{r}
a <- marray(sample(100)[1L:24L], dim = c(4, 3, 2))
masubset(a)
masubset(a, subset = (a > 23) & (a <= 67))
```

## Getting axes indices

Note: The result from `masubset()` can directly be used as input for `axesindices()` to retrieve the axes indices of these array elements.

```{r}
a <- marray(1:24, dim = c(4, 3, 2))
axesindices(a, value = c(11, 2, 23, 100))

a <- marray(sample(6, 24, replace = TRUE), dim = c(4, 3, 2))
axesindices(a, value = c(3, 5))
```


## Axes permutation (transposition)

Transposition of an array can be done with:

- `transpose()`: needs the entire new order of the shape
- `rearrange()`: needs the axes along to read for permutation; these axes are put at last positions in the entire shape
- `swapaxes()`: interchanges two axes
- `moveaxis()`: moves axes of an array to new positions while the other axes remain in their original order

```{r}
a <- marray(1:12, dim = c(3, 2, 2), order = "F")
# transpose
transpose(a, perm = c(2, 1, 3))

# rearrange
rearrange(a, axis = c(1, 2))

# swapaxes
swapaxes(a, axis1 = 1, axis2 = 3)

# move axes
a <- marray(1:(3*4*5), dim = c(3, 4, 5), order = "F")
DIM(moveaxis(a, 1, 3))
DIM(moveaxis(a, 3, 1))
DIM(moveaxis(a, source = c(1, 2), destination = c(3, 1)))
a <- marray(1:24, dim = c(4, 3, 2, 1))
DIM(moveaxis(a, source = c(1, 4), destination = c(3, 2)))

m <- marray(1:12, dim = c(4, 3))
DIM(moveaxis(m, 1, 2)) # transpose(m)
```

## Flattening

### Keep array with one dimension

```{r}
a4 <- marray(seq_len(4*3*2*2), dim = c(4, 3, 2, 2)); a4
flatten(a4)
```

### Drop dimension information

Special flatten functions drop dimension information from array and return

- `flatten_int()` an integer vector
- `flatten_dbl()` a numeric vector
- `flatten_raw()` a raw vector
- `flatten_chr()` a character vector
- `flatten_lgl()` a logical vector

```{r}
flatten_int(a4)
flatten_dbl(a4)
flatten_raw(a4)
flatten_chr(a4)
flatten_lgl(a4)
```

## Expanding and Squeezing

- `expand_dims()`: inserts a new axis that will appear at a certain position in the expanded array shape
- `squeeze()`: compresses the shape of an array by removing singleton dimensions

```{r}
a <- marray(seq_len(12)); a
# Expand array with an axis on first
expand_dims(a, axis = 1); a
# Expand array with an axis on last
a <- expand_dims(a); a
# Drop all axes within the array with a length equal 1
a <- squeeze(a); a
```

## Reshaping and Resizing

`Reshaping` gives an array a new shape but keeps the number of elements. `Resizing`, in opposite, enlarges the number of elements, if necessary. If the new array is larger than the original array, then the new array is filled with:

- `copy`: repeated copies of the array
- `zero`: zeros
- `na` : NA
- `approx`: approximated values

```{r}
a <- marray(runif(4*4, min = 1, max = 16), dim = c(4, 4))

# Reshape array
reshape.array(a, dim = c(4, 2, 2))

# Resize array
resize.array(a, dim = c(5, 5))
resize.array(a, dim = c(5, 5), fill = "zero")
resize.array(a, dim = c(5, 5), fill = "na")
resize.array(a, dim = c(5, 5), fill = "approx")
```


Also a broadcasting mechanism is implemented. *Broadcasting* refers to a concept where the shape of arrays are coerced to shapes which makes operations, e.g. binding, along axes possible. A *broadcast dimension space* shows a template for those shape the arrays must be meet.

```{r}
v <- 1:4
a <- array(1:24, dim = c(4, 3, 1))

# Broadcast shape
broadcastDIM(v, a, axis = 2)
# Reshape arrays to get them work together along axes
# v can only be binded along axis 2 on a. Therefor, the shape of v must be 4x1x1
arys <- reshape_broadcast(v, a, axis = 2)
```


## Rolling

*Rolling* describes an array circulation whereby elements of the array are shifted along axes and re-introduced at the first position if they roll beyond the last position.

```{r}
a <- marray(0:9)
# roll forward
roll(a, shift = 2)
# roll backward
roll(a, shift = -2)

a <- marray(a, dim = c(2, 5))
a
roll(a, shift = 1)
roll(a, shift = -1)
roll(a, shift = 1, axis = 1)
roll(a, shift = -1, axis = 1)
```


## Insertion and deletion

- `insert()`: inserts an R object into an array
- `delete()`: deletes parts from an array
- `erase()`: deletes axis from array

```{r}
# Insert into array along axis
a <- marray(seq.int(2*3*4), dim = c(2, 3, 4), order = "F")
x <- marray(100L + seq.int(2*1*4))
insert(a, x, axis = 2L, order = "F")

x <- marray(100L + seq.int(2*3*1))
insert(a, x, axis = 3L, order = "F")

# Original array
a <- marray(1:24, dim = c(4, 3, 2), order = "F")
# delete nothing
delete(a)
# delete positions 1 and 2 of the first axis
delete(a, i = 1:2)
# delete second row and third column
delete(a, i = 2, j = 3)

# original array
a <- marray(1:24, dim = c(4, 3, 2), order = "F")
# delete the first dimension with reading first n elements
erase(a)
# delete the first dimension with reading last n elements
erase(a, keep = "last")
# delete the axes one and two with reading first n elements
erase(a, axis = c(1L, 2L))
```

## Replacing and Clipping

- `mareplace()`: replaces values of an entire array or only of a slice
- `maclip()`: limits the values in an array

```{r}
a <- zeros(dim = c(4, 3))
# Replace values of the entire array
mareplace(a, oldvalue = 0, newvalue = 2)
# Replace values only of a slice of the array
mareplace(a, i = 2:3, j = 2, oldvalue = 0, newvalue = 2)

a <- marray(1:24, dim = c(4, 3, 2))
# Limit entire array
maclip(a, a_min = 3, a_max = 7)
# Limit only a slice of the array
maclip(a, i = 1:2, j = 2:3, a_min = 3, a_max = 7)
```

## Copying

```{r}
a0 <- zeros(dim = c(4, 3, 2))
a1 <- ones(dim = c(3, 3))
copyto(a0, a1, dst_axis_index = list(i = 2:3, j = 1:2), src_axis_index = list(i = 1:2, j = 2:3))
```


## Binding arrays together

### Common binding

The function `mabind()` binds arrays along an axis. All arrays must have the same shape excluding axis. The function tries to coerce all arrays into the right shape, if necessary.

```{r}
v1 <- 1:5
v2 <- 6:10
mabind(v1, v2)

v <- 1:4
m <- marray(1:12, dim = c(4, 3))
mabind(m, v)

v <- 1:3
mabind(m, v, axis = 1)

x <- marray(seq_len(24), dim = c(4, 3, 2), order = "F")
y <- marray(-seq_len(24), dim = c(4, 3, 2), order = "F")
z <- marray(seq_len(12), dim = c(4, 3))
mabind(x, y, z)

# That's not necessary because mabind() coerces arrays, if it's possible
a <- expand_dims(z) |>
  list() |>
  append(list(x, y), 0L) |>
  mabind()

a <- marray(1:11)
b <- marray(2:23)
mabind(a, NULL, b)

a <- marray(sample(12), dim = c(4, 3))
b <- marray(sample(12), dim = c(4, 3, 1))
c <- marray(1:12)
d <- marray(sample(12), dim = c(4, 3, 1))
e <- marray(sample(4*3*1*1), dim = c(4, 3, 1, 1))
mabind(a, b, c, d, e)
```

### Special binding

The following functions provide special binding opportunities:

- `vstack()`: stacks arrays in sequence vertically (row-wise); it's equivalent to `mabind(..., axis = 1)`
- `hstack()`: stacks arrays in sequence horizontally (column-wise); it's equivalent to `mabind(..., axis = 2)`
- `dstack()`: stacks arrays in sequence along the third axis (depth-wise); it's equivalent to `mabind(..., axis = 3)`
- `column_stack()`: stacks 1-D arrays as columns into a 2-D array
- `row_stack()`: stacks 1-D arrays as rows into a 2-D array

The functions `vstack()`, `hstack()`, and `dstack()` coerces arrays in the corresponding right shape (1-D, 2-D, or 3-D)

```{r}
# row-wise stacking
vstack(c(11, 2, 23), c(4, 10, 67))
vstack(marray(1:6, dim = c(3, 2)), marray(-1:-6, dim = c(3, 2)))
# column-wise stacking
hstack(c(11, 2, 23), c(4, 10, 67))
hstack(marray(1:6, dim = c(3, 2)), marray(-1:-6, dim = c(3, 2)))
# depth-wise stacking with automatic coercing in the right shape (3-dimensional arrays)
dstack(marray(1:6, dim = c(3, 2)), marray(-1:-6, dim = c(3, 2)))
```

## Splitting

### Common splitting

```{r}
a <- marray(1:8)
array_split(a, indices_or_sections = 3)
array_split(a, indices_or_sections = c(3, 5, 6))

a <- marray(1:12, dim = c(4, 3))
array_split(a, indices_or_sections = 2)
array_split(a, indices_or_sections = c(3, 4), axis = 1L)

a <- marray(1:24, dim = c(4, 3, 2), order = "F")
array_split(a, indices_or_sections = 2)
array_split(a, indices_or_sections = 2, axis = 2L)
```

### Special splitting

Special splitting functions are:

- `vsplit()`: splits an array into multiple sub-arrays vertically (row-wise)
- `hsplit()`: splits an array into multiple sub-arrays horizontally (column-wise)
- `dsplit()`: splits an array into multiple sub-arrays along the third axis (depth-wise)

```{r}
vsplit(marray(1:12, dim = c(4, 3)), indices_or_sections = 2)
hsplit(marray(1:12, dim = c(4, 3)), indices_or_sections = 2)
dsplit(marray(1:24, dim = c(4, 3, 2)), indices_or_sections = 2)
```

## Repeating and Tiling

*Repeating* means repetition of elements of an array along axes. 

```{r}
a <- marray(seq_len(4*4*2), dim = c(4, 4, 2))
marepeat(a, repeats = 2, axis = 1)
marepeat(a, repeats = c(2, 2, 3, 1), axis = 1)
marepeat(a, repeats = c(2, 2, 1, 1), axis = c(1, 2))
marepeat(a, repeats = c(2, 2, 1, 1), axis = 1) |> marepeat(repeats = c(2, 2, 1, 1), axis = 2)
marepeat(a, repeats = list(i = c(2, 1, 2, 1), j = c(1, 2, 3, 2)), axis = c(1, 2))
```

*Tiling* repeats an array along each axes. 

```{r}
a <- marray(c(0, 1, 2))
tile(a, 3)
tile(a, c(2, 2))
tile(a, c(2, 1, 2))

a <- marray(1:4, dim = c(2, 2))
tile(a, 2)
tile(a, c(2, 1))

## Sliding

*Sliding* is a technique in which a window slides over the entire array with a stride length and returns a list of sub-arrays with a dimension equal to the window size.

```{r}
a <- marray(sample(7*4*2), dim = c(7, 4, 2))
# sliding along each axes with a size of 1 and a stride of 1
arys1 <- slide(a)
# sliding along first and second axes with sizes of 2 and 1 and a stride of 1 for both axes
arys2 <- slide(a, size = c(2, 1), axis = c(1, 2)) 
```


## Flipping

### Common flipping

*Flipping* describes the technique of reversing the order of elements in an array along axes. Flipping along one axis can be exemplified with a matrix. If the order of the elements along the first dimension (row) is to be reversed, it is helpful to imagine a horizontal axis (from left to right) in the middle of the matrix where flipping takes place. The first row becomes the last, the second row the second last and so on until the last row becomes the first. The same applies for reversing the order of the elements along the second dimension (column), with the distinction that the flipping axis is a vertical axis (from top to bottom) in the middle of the matrix.

```{r}
a <- marray(seq_len(24), dim = c(4, 3, 2), order = "F")
a
# flip along first axis
flip(a)
# flip along second axis
flip(a, axis = 2L)
# flip along third axis
flip(a, axis = 3L)
# flip along first and second axis
flip(a, axis = c(1L, 2L))
```

### Special flipping

- `flipup()`: flips an array vertically, so along axis = 1
- `fliplr()`: flips an array horizontally, so along axis = 2

```{r}
flipud(a)
fliplr(a)
```

## Rotating

*Rotating* denotes a technique in which an array is rotated by 90 degree either in clockwise or in counterclockwise direction.

```{r}
a <- marray(seq_len(6), dim = c(3, 2), order = "F")
a
# clockwise rotating
rot90(a)
# clockwise two-times
rot90(a, k = 2L)
# counterclockwise rotating
rot90(a, k = -1L)
# counterclockwise three-times
rot90(a, k = -3L)
```

## Cropping

*Cropping* denotes a technique in which a slice of an array is extracted (and therefor focused) while the remaining values of the array beyond the slice are filled with a certain value.

```{r}
a <- marray(1:24, dim = c(4, 3, 2))
a
crop(a, i = 1, j = 2:3)
```

## Embed series

```{r}
a <- marray(1:24, dim = c(6, 4), order = "F")
a
embedseries(a, length = 3L)
```
